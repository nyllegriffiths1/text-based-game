Game Instructions

After starting the game, you'll be prompted to enter your name. This personalizes your adventure.
You'll then be presented with a main menu where you can choose to explore different areas, check your inventory, check your health, or exit the game.
As you explore, you'll encounter different locations like the Dark Forest, the Quiet Village, the Riverbank, and the Abandoned Castle.
In certain locations, you might find items to add to your inventory or face enemies in combat.
Use your wit to survive the challenges and see how far you can go in your adventure!
Controls
Navigate Menus: Type the number corresponding to your choice and press Enter.
Make Decisions: When asked a yes/no question, type "yes" or "no" and press Enter.
Combat: During combat, you'll be given options to attack or run. Type the corresponding number and press Enter.
Skills Practiced
This project is a great way for me to practice and improve my C# programming skills. Specifically, I've been focusing on:

Basic Syntax and Control Structures: Using loops, conditionals, and variables to create game logic.
Object-Oriented Programming: Implementing classes and methods to organize code and manage game state.
Encapsulation and Access Modifiers: Using private methods to encapsulate functionality and control access to class members.
Collections: Managing the player's inventory using a Dictionary to store and retrieve items.
Randomization: Simulating combat with random damage values to add unpredictability to the game.
User Interaction: Handling user input and providing meaningful feedback through the console.
Work in Progress
Please note that this game is a work in progress. I plan to continue adding new features and expanding the storyline as I learn more about C# and game development. Future enhancements might include:

More complex combat mechanics
Additional locations and story branches
Saving and loading game states
Improved inventory management with more item types
